Did you know that modern power cables have a fiber core and the cables
used in Factorio are no exception. Every power cable that was ever
placed in your factory actually has a number of optical fibers in it.

Fiber optic cables are good for one thing: Transfer signals over long
distances. However, up until now, there was no way to access them.

Fiber optics technology provides a connector that can transfer up to
16 red/green signal pairs across a power network. Multiple power
networks are supported.
